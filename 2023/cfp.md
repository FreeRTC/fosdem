# FOSDEM - Real Time Communications devroom CfP

## Overview

[FOSDEM] is one of the world's premier meetings of free software developers,
with over five thousand people attending each year. FOSDEM 2023
takes place 4-5 February 2023 and it will be an in-person event once again!

This document contains information about:

- Real-Time Communications developer room (devroom)
- speaking opportunities
- volunteering

## Call for participation - Real Time Communications (RTC)

The Real-Time devroom is about all things involving real-time communication,
including: XMPP, SIP, WebRTC, telephony, mobile VoIP, codecs, peer-to-peer,
privacy and encryption.

**We are looking for speakers for the devroom and volunteers who can help
manage the scheduling and live Q&A sessions.**

The devroom will take place for half a day, likely on Sunday.

To discuss the devroom, volunteer or ask questions, please join the
[Free-RTC mailing list].

### Key dates

- 4-5 February: Conference date

### Speaking opportunities

Note: if you used FOSDEM Pentabarf before, please use the same account/username

Real-Time Communications devroom: deadline 23:59 UTC on 27th of November.

Please use the [Pentabarf] system to submit a talk proposal for the
devroom. On the "General" tab, please look for the "Track" option and
choose "Real Time Communications devroom".

### First-time speaking?

FOSDEM devrooms are a welcoming environment for people who have never
given a talk before. Please feel free to contact the devroom administrators
personally if you would like to ask any questions about it.

### Submission guidelines

The Pentabarf system will ask for many of the essential details. Please
remember to re-use your account from previous years if you have one.

In the "Submission notes", please tell us about:

- The purpose of your talk
- Any other talk applications (devrooms, lightning talks, main track)
- Availability constraints and special needs

You can use HTML and links in your bio, abstract and description.

If you maintain a blog, please consider providing us with the
URL of a feed with posts tagged for your RTC-related work.

We will be looking for relevance to the conference and devroom themes,
presentations aimed at developers of free and open source software about
RTC-related topics.

Please feel free to suggest a duration between 20 minutes and 55 minutes
but note that the final decision on talk durations will be made by the
devroom administrators based on the number of received proposals.
As the two previous devrooms have been combined into one, we may decide to
give shorter slots than in previous years so that more speakers can
participate.

Please note FOSDEM aims to record and live-stream all talks.
