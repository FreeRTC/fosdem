## New rules for the online edition

This year FOSDEM will be fully online instead of being held in Brussels,
here are the most important things to know about this (quite significant)
change:

- The reference time will be Brussels local time (CET)
- Talks will be pre-recorded in advance, and streamed during the event
- The Q/A session will be live
- A facility will be provided for people watching to chat between themselves
- A facility will be provided for people watching to submit questions

## Call for participation - Real Time Communications (RTC)

The Real-Time devroom is about all things involving real-time communication,
including: XMPP, SIP, WebRTC, telephony, mobile VoIP, codecs, peer-to-peer,
privacy and encryption.

**We are looking for speakers for the devroom and volunteers who can help
manage the scheduling and live Q&A sessions.**

The devroom is only on Saturday, 6th of February 2021.

To discuss the devroom, volunteer or ask questions, please join the
[Free-RTC mailing list].

### Speaking opportunities

Note: if you used FOSDEM Pentabarf before, please use the same account/username

Real-Time Communications devroom: deadline 23:59 UTC on 20th of December.
Please use the [Pentabarf] system to submit a talk proposal for the
devroom. On the "General" tab, please look for the "Track" option and
choose "Real Time Communications devroom".

### First-time speaking?

FOSDEM devrooms are a welcoming environment for people who have never
given a talk before. Please feel free to contact the devroom administrators
personally if you would like to ask any questions about it.

This year this is more true than ever, being able to record your presentation
offline without an audience in front can greatly help build up one's confidence!

### Submission guidelines

The Pentabarf system will ask for many of the essential details. Please
remember to re-use your account from previous years if you have one.

In the "Submission notes", please tell us about:

- The purpose of your talk
- Any other talk applications (devrooms, lightning talks, main track)
- Availability constraints and special needs

You can use HTML and links in your bio, abstract and description.

If you maintain a blog, please consider providing us with the
URL of a feed with posts tagged for your RTC-related work.

We will be looking for relevance to the conference and devroom themes,
presentations aimed at developers of free and open source software about
RTC-related topics.

Please feel free to suggest a duration between 20 minutes and 55 minutes
but note that the final decision on talk durations will be made by the
devroom administrators based on the number of received proposals.
As the two previous devrooms have been combined into one, we may decide to
give shorter slots than in previous years so that more speakers can
participate.

Please note FOSDEM aims to record and live-stream all talks.
The CC-BY license is used.

### Recording help

The devroom organization is able to provide help with recording your session.
The recording would be performed at a scheduled time with one of us, so you
won't be alone giving your presentation. Minimal edits will be possible, but
the ideal plan is to record it in one shot.

Thanks Dan Jenkins for providing us with the means to do this!

## Volunteers needed

To make the devroom run successfully, we are looking for volunteers. This year
many things be done for the first time, so all the help we can get is more
than welcome.

## Spread the word and discuss

If you know of any mailing lists where this CfP would be relevant, please
forward this document. If this devroom excites you, please blog or microblog
about it, especially if you are submitting a talk.

If you regularly blog about RTC topics, please send details about your
blog to the planet site administrators:
