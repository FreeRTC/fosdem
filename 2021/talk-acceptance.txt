We'd like to thank you for your enthusiasm to participate and confirm
that we are accepting your talk in the Real Time Communications devroom.

Devroom talks are all day on Saturday, 6th February.

What now?
=========

This year is a special one due to the online nature of FOSDEM. Please be sure
to ask any questions you may have.

- All RTC devroom talks are 20 minutes this year, prerecorded as you know, with
a 5 minute live Q&A afterwards. Check your allocated slot in the schedule [0]
and let us know (details below) if you can't make it for the live Q&A.

- You can find some resources for recording your talk at the end of this email.

- You can use the address
fosdem-rtc-admin@freertc.org to contact the devroom admins
about talks - please reply on that address.

- Please reply to advise if you are unable to record you talk on time.

- Please update your personal description and talk description in the
pentabarf system before we publicize them.  You can use the wiki markup
syntax[1] supported by Pentabarf to create links from the descriptions
to your own project web-sites and we would encourage you to make good use
of this.  You can continuously update the profile after it goes public,
the site is refreshed from time to time throughout the day and then it
is archived when FOSDEM finishes.

- We will promote the schedule (both main track and devroom) over the
next few weeks, using blogs, the Free-RTC mailing list and the FOSDEM
web site, please help to share the links within your community as they
appear.

- Please use the Free-RTC list[2] to discuss any other aspect of RTC
at FOSDEM.

- Please be aware FOSDEM has adopted a Code of Conduct[3] and the
devroom administrators fully support this.  As volunteers and speakers,
people will be looking to our example.  Furthermore, this means that if
something awkward happens, it comes down to us to be first to act and
show leadership.  Please feel free to ask any questions about this topic
through the main FOSDEM mailing list.


Recording your talk
===================

There currently is no set deadline, but we'd like to make sure all recordings
are uploaded before the 29th of January.

The RTC devroom team can help you record your talk by recording a live session
with a host, reach out if you'd like to record your talk in this manner.

The FOSDEM team has put together a guide at [4] to help you self record your
talk.

You can also use an online video conferencing tool such as Jitsi [5] to do
your own recording.

In [6] you can check a video guide on how to use OBS to make your own recording.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us!



We are delighted to have received such exciting proposals and look
forward to collaborating with you over the weeks ahead.

Regards,

The FOSDEM RTC Devroom team.
