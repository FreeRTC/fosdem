Real Time Communications (RTC)


Description
-----------
The Real-Time devroom is about all
things involving communicating in  real-time, including: XMPP, SIP, other signaling
protocols, WebRTC, telephony, mobile VoIP, codecs, peer-to-peer, privacy and
encryption. It's focused on in-depth technical topics about all the above, including
Open Source projects in any of their realms.


Why does it fit FOSDEM
----------------------
Communicating is something us humans do every single day in different
capacities.  Both for personal and business reasons, and as Free Software
enthusiasts it's important to keep our conversations under our own control.

We've seen companies shut down services which people relied on (Google Talk),
damaging Open Standards in the process (XMPP).

These days tons of private communication happens through the services offered
by private, for-profit, and privacy endangering companies such as Facebook.

FOSDEM is a great place to show others that a different way is possible and
that we have the technology, capability and existing projects to control our
own communications.

Moreover, and with the COVID-19 pandemic still not over, tons of interaction
has moved to an online capacity, and making sure such interactions occur using
Open Source software which provides the necessary privacy and security aspects
is more important than ever.
