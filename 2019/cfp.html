<p>The Real-Time Communications dev-room and Real-Time lounge is about all things involving real-time communication, including: XMPP, SIP, WebRTC, telephony, mobile VoIP, codecs, peer-to-peer, privacy and encryption.  The dev-room is a successor to the previous XMPP and telephony dev-rooms.  We are looking for speakers for the dev-room and volunteers and participants for the tables in the Real-Time lounge.</p>

<p>The dev-room is only on Sunday, 3rf of February 2019.  The lounge will be present for both days.</p>

<p>Other dev-rooms and lightning talks: some speakers may find their topic is in the scope of more than one dev-room.  It is encouraged to apply to more than one dev-room and also consider proposing a lightning talk, but please be kind enough to tell us if you do this by filling out the notes in the form.</p>

<p>You can find the full list of dev-rooms <a href="https://www.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/tracks/">on this page</a> and apply for a lightning talk at https://fosdem.org/submit</p>

<p>Main track: the deadline for main track presentations is 23:59 UTC 3 November.  Leading developers in the Real-Time Communications field are encouraged to consider <a href="https://fosdem.org/submit">submitting a presentation to the main track</a>.</p>

<h3>First-time speaking?</h3>

<p>FOSDEM dev-rooms are a welcoming environment for people who have never given a talk before.  Please feel free to contact the dev-room administrators personally if you would like to ask any questions about it.</p>

<h3>Submission guidelines</h3>

<p>The Pentabarf system will ask for many of the essential details.  Please remember to re-use your account from previous years if you have one.</p>

<p>In the "Submission notes", please tell us about:</p>
<ul>
<li>the purpose of your talk</li>
<li>any other talk applications (dev-rooms, lightning talks, main track)</li>
<li>availability constraints and special needs</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use HTML and links in your bio, abstract and description.</p>

<p>If you maintain a blog, please consider providing us with the URL of a feed with posts tagged for your RTC-related work.</p>

<p>We will be looking for relevance to the conference and dev-room themes, presentations aimed at developers of free and open source software about RTC-related topics.</p>

<p>Please feel free to suggest a duration between 20 minutes and 55 minutes but note that the final decision on talk durations will be made by the dev-room administrators based on the received proposals.  As the two previous dev-rooms have been combined into one, we may decide to give shorter slots than in previous years so that more speakers can participate.</p>

<p>Please note FOSDEM aims to record and live-stream all talks.  The CC-BY license is used.</p>

<h2>Volunteers needed</h2>

<p>To make the dev-room and lounge run successfully, we are looking for volunteers:</p>

<ul>
<li>FOSDEM provides video recording equipment and live streaming, volunteers are needed to assist in this</li>
<li>organizing one or more restaurant bookings (dependending upon number of participants) for the evening of Saturday, 4 February</li>
<li>participation in the Real-Time lounge</li>
<li>helping attract sponsorship funds for the dev-room to pay for the Saturday night dinner and any other expenses</li>
<li>circulating this Call for Participation (this text) to other mailing lists</li>
</ul>

<h2>Social events and dinners</h2>

<p>The traditional FOSDEM beer night occurs on Friday, 1st of February.</p>

<p>On Saturday night, there are usually dinners associated with each of the dev-rooms.  Most restaurants in Brussels are not so large so these dinners have space constraints and reservations are essential.  Please subscribe to the <a href="https://lists.fsfe.org/mailman/listinfo/free-rtc">Free-RTC mailing list</a> for further details about the Saturday night dinner options and how you can register for a seat.</p>

<h2>Spread the word and discuss</h2>

<p>If you know of any mailing lists where this CfP would be relevant, please forward this email. If this dev-room excites you, please blog or microblog about it, especially if you are submitting a talk.</p>

<p>If you regularly blog about RTC topics, please send details about your blog to the planet site administrators:</p>
