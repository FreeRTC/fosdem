We'd like to thank you for your enthusiasm to participate and confirm
that we are accepting your talk in the Real Time Communications dev-room.

Dev-room talks are all day on Sunday, 4 February.  What's more, RTC will
be in the main track again this year and we also have the Real-time Lounge
again in the K building on both days.

What now?

- most RTC dev-room talks are 20 minutes this year, some are 15 minutes,
with a 5 minute break between speakers.  Due to the large number of talks
these times will be strictly enforced and we ask for your full
cooperation to make the process as smooth as possible during each
changeover.

- you can use the address
fosdem-rtc-admin@freertc.org to contact the dev-room admins
about talks - please reply on that address

- please reply to advise if you are still coming or not

- if you have availability / time constraints on 4 February, please
update the notes for us in Pentabarf and send us an email if your
allocated time slot in the schedule[7] needs to be changed

- please update your personal description and talk description in the
pentabarf system before we publicize them.  You can use the wiki markup
syntax[1] supported by Pentabarf to create links from the descriptions
to your own project web-sites and we would encourage you to make good use
of this.  You can continuously update the profile after it goes public,
the site is refreshed from time to time throughout the day and then it
is archived when FOSDEM finishes.

- we will promote the schedule (both main track and dev-room) over the
next few weeks, using blogs, the Free-RTC mailing list and the FOSDEM
web site, please help to share the links within your community as they
appear.

- everybody is welcome to participate in the Real-Time lounge on both
days of FOSDEM, please join the discussion on the Free-RTC list to
coordinate

- if you would like to be included in any of the planet sites, please
contact Ralph or myself as described in the call for participation[5]

- it would be great to have one or more dinners for the RTC community on
3 February, please join the discussion on the Free-RTC list to coordinate

- you can use the address fosdem2018-rtc-speakers@freertc.org to
contact all speakers, but please use the public Free-RTC mailing list
whenever possible

- please use the Free-RTC list[4] to discuss any other aspect of RTC
at FOSDEM

- Please be aware FOSDEM has adopted a Code of Conduct[6] and the
dev-room administrators fully support this.  As volunteers and speakers,
people will be looking to our example.  Furthermore, this means that if
something awkward happens, it comes down to us to be first to act and
show leadership.  Please feel free to ask any questions about this topic
through the main FOSDEM mailing list.

We are delighted to have received such exciting proposals and look
forward to collaborating with you over the weeks ahead.

Regards,

The FOSDEM RTC Devroom team.
