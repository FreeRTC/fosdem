### First-time speaking?

FOSDEM devrooms are a welcoming environment for people who have never
given a talk before. Please feel free to contact the devroom administrators
personally if you would like to ask any questions about it.

### Submission guidelines

Please use the [Pretalx] system to submit a talk proposal for the
devroom.

We will be looking for relevance to the conference and devroom themes,
presentations aimed at developers of free and open source software about
RTC-related topics.
