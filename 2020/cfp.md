## Call for participation - Real Time Communications (RTC)

The Real-Time devroom and Real-Time lounge are about all things involving
real-time communication, including: XMPP, SIP, WebRTC, telephony,
mobile VoIP, codecs, peer-to-peer, privacy and encryption.

**We are looking for speakers for the devroom and volunteers and
participants for the tables in the Real-Time lounge.**

The devroom is only on Sunday, 2nd of February 2020. The lounge will
be present for both days.

To discuss the devroom and lounge, please join the
[Free-RTC mailing list].

### Speaking opportunities

Note: if you used FOSDEM Pentabarf before, please use the same account/username

Real-Time Communications devroom: deadline 23:59 UTC on 15th of December.
Please use the [Pentabarf] system to submit a talk proposal for the
devroom. On the "General" tab, please look for the "Track" option and
choose "Real Time Communications devroom".

Other devrooms and lightning talks: some speakers may find their topic is
in the scope of more than one devroom. It is encouraged to apply to more
than one devroom and also consider proposing a lightning talk, but please
be kind enough to tell us if you do this by filling out the notes in the form.
Here you can find the [full list of devrooms] and here you can apply for
a [lightning talk].

### First-time speaking?

FOSDEM devrooms are a welcoming environment for people who have never
given a talk before. Please feel free to contact the devroom administrators
personally if you would like to ask any questions about it.

### Submission guidelines

The Pentabarf system will ask for many of the essential details. Please
remember to re-use your account from previous years if you have one.

In the "Submission notes", please tell us about:

- The purpose of your talk
- Any other talk applications (devrooms, lightning talks, main track)
- Availability constraints and special needs

You can use HTML and links in your bio, abstract and description.

If you maintain a blog, please consider providing us with the
URL of a feed with posts tagged for your RTC-related work.

We will be looking for relevance to the conference and devroom themes,
presentations aimed at developers of free and open source software about
RTC-related topics.

Please feel free to suggest a duration between 20 minutes and 55 minutes
but note that the final decision on talk durations will be made by the
devroom administrators based on the number of received proposals.
As the two previous devrooms have been combined into one, we may decide to
give shorter slots than in previous years so that more speakers can
participate.

Please note FOSDEM aims to record and live-stream all talks.

## Volunteers needed

To make the devroom and lounge run successfully, we are looking for
volunteers:

- FOSDEM provides video recording equipment and live streaming,
  volunteers are needed to assist in this
- Organizing one or more restaurant bookings (dependending upon number of
  participants) for the evening of Saturday, 1 February
- Participation in the Real-Time lounge
- Circulating this Call for Participation to other mailing lists

## Social events and dinners

The traditional FOSDEM beer night occurs on Friday, 31st of January.

On Saturday night, there are usually dinners associated with
each of the devrooms. Most restaurants in Brussels are not so
large so these dinners have space constraints and reservations are
essential. Please subscribe to the [Free-RTC mailing list] for
further details about the Saturday night dinner options and how
you can register for a seat.

## Related events around FOSDEM

As per usual, the [XMPP Summit] is happening ahead of FOSDEM. This time it will

are available on the [summit website].
