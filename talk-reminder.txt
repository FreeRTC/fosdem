Reminder: speaker's deadline tomorrow, 17 November at 23:59 UTC

The Free RTC dev-room has already received some really exciting
talk proposals but there is still time for people to propose talks or
encourage friends or colleagues to speak.

Many other dev-rooms also have a deadline in the next few days and if
your topic is applicable to more than one dev-room, you are welcome
to make more than one submission.  Please contact us or put a note in
the memo field at the top of the talk proposal if you do that.

All projects are encouraged to consider making a lightning talk too,
it is an excellent opportunity to get exposure for your project:
even though you only have 15 minutes, it can be a much larger and more
diverse audience than in some dev-rooms.

For full details, please see the original call for participation:

We invite all potential speakers and participants to discuss the selection 
process and other aspects of FOSDEM on the Free-RTC mailing list:
